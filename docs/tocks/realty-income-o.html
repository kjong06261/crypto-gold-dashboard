<h1>Realty Income (O): Engineering Reliable Monthly Cash Flow | 리얼티 인컴(O): 월 배당 패시브 인컴 엔진</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>리얼티 인컴(Realty Income, O)은 월 단위로 현금 흐름을 창출하도록 설계된 대표적인 패시브 인컴 자산입니다. 순임대(Net-Lease) 구조와 장기 계약 기반의 임대 수익은 배당의 예측 가능성을 극대화합니다. 장기 투자자 관점에서 이 종목은 단순한 고배당주가 아니라 안정적인 현금 흐름 엔진에 가깝습니다.</p>

<h2>1. Corporate Profile</h2>
<p>Realty Income is a U.S.-based net-lease REIT focused on single-tenant commercial properties. Its core business model relies on long-term triple-net (NNN) leases, under which tenants are responsible for property taxes, insurance, and maintenance.</p>

<p>This structure significantly reduces operating cost volatility and allows the REIT to convert rental revenue into predictable cash flow. The portfolio spans more than ten thousand properties across retail, service, and industrial segments, with exposure extending beyond the United States into select international markets.</p>

<p>Tenant quality is a central pillar of the model. Realty Income prioritizes investment-grade or business-essential tenants, which reduces default risk and enhances income durability across economic cycles.</p>

<h2>2. Dividend Analysis</h2>
<p>Realty Income has paid dividends monthly since 1994, a record that spans multiple economic downturns including the dot-com collapse, the Global Financial Crisis, and the COVID-19 recession. This consistency places the company in the same qualitative category as Dividend Aristocrats, despite REITs being excluded from the formal index.</p>

<p>Dividend growth has been modest but persistent. Over the long term, dividend CAGR has averaged in the low single digits, reflecting a deliberate focus on sustainability rather than aggressive payout expansion.</p>

<p>For REIT analysis, earnings per share (EPS) is less relevant than Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO). Realty Income’s payout ratio, typically in the 75–80% AFFO range, indicates strong distribution coverage and a meaningful margin of safety.</p>

<p>This structure explains why the stock’s elevated yield does not represent a yield trap. The dividend is funded by recurring operating cash flow rather than leverage or asset sales.</p>

<h2>3. Financial Health</h2>
<p>Balance sheet strength is a defining advantage for Realty Income. The company maintains an investment-grade credit rating, a rarity within the REIT sector, which directly lowers its cost of capital.</p>

<p>Debt is predominantly fixed-rate with a long weighted-average maturity profile, limiting exposure to interest rate volatility. Interest coverage ratios remain conservative, reinforcing dividend safety even during tightening monetary conditions.</p>

<p>This financial health allows Realty Income to pursue acquisitions opportunistically while weaker competitors are constrained, reinforcing long-term cash flow stability.</p>

<h2>4. Moat & Risks</h2>

<h3>Moat</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Scale advantage across thousands of properties</li>
  <li>Lower cost of capital due to strong credit profile</li>
  <li>High tenant diversification with limited concentration risk</li>
  <li>Resilience driven by non-discretionary tenant mix</li>
</ul>

<h3>Risks</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Prolonged high interest rate environment</li>
  <li>Inflation impacting tenant margins</li>
  <li>Structural changes in retail behavior</li>
  <li>Acquisition discipline during expansion phases</li>
</ul>

<p>These risks are structural rather than existential, but they require continuous monitoring by income-focused investors.</p>

<h2>5. 2026 Outlook</h2>
<p>Looking toward 2026, the base-case outlook for Realty Income centers on steady AFFO growth in the low-to-mid single digits. Dividend growth is expected to track AFFO expansion, maintaining payout stability.</p>

<p>A stabilizing interest rate environment would support valuation multiples, while international expansion provides incremental growth optionality. In downside scenarios, the conservative balance sheet remains the primary buffer protecting cash flow.</p>
